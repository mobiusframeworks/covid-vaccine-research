**Tier 2 (High Quality):**
- Sources 16, 17, 20, 29, 33, 36, 41 (mechanistic studies, systematic reviews)

**Tier 3 (Important Context):**
- Sources 7, 9, 10, 22, 37, 52 (historical, surveillance, educational)

**Tier 4 (Use with Caution):**
- Sources 31, 38, 45, 75, 76 (controversial or hypothesis-generating)

### Recommended Reading Order

**For Overview:**
1. Start with sources 1-5 (mechanism)
2. Read sources 6-10 (history)
3. Review sources 11, 14 (efficacy)
4. Examine sources 35, 26 (long-term safety, cardiovascular)

**For Myocarditis Deep Dive:**
1. Source 18 (ESC consensus - treatment)
2. Source 16 (Stanford mechanism)
3. Source 20 (MACiV outcomes)
4. Source 28 (PCORnet comparative risk)

**For Risk-Benefit Assessment:**
1. Source 35 (France mortality)
2. Source 26 (England cardiovascular)
3. Source 28 (PCORnet cardiac comparison)
4. Source 11 (Moderna efficacy trial)

## Gaps in Literature Identified

1. **Long-term (>5 years) safety data** - Longest follow-up is 4 years
2. **Mechanism of sex-based myocarditis risk** - Why young males?
3. **Clinical significance of spike protein persistence** - Detection vs pathology
4. **Optimal dosing strategies** - Personalized vaccination schedules
5. **Very rare adverse events** - Insufficient power to detect <1 in 100,000
6. **Reproductive health outcomes** - Limited long-term fertility data
7. **Pediatric long-term data** - Children have shorter follow-up periods

## Search Strategy for Additional Sources

**PubMed Search String:**
```
("COVID-19 vaccine"[MeSH] OR "mRNA vaccine" OR "BNT162b2" OR "mRNA-1273")
AND
("safety" OR "adverse events" OR "myocarditis" OR "efficacy" OR "effectiveness" OR "mortality")
AND
("2020"[Date - Publication] : "2026"[Date - Publication])
AND

```

**Filters:**
- Clinical trials
- Cohort studies
- Meta-analyses
- Systematic reviews
- Sample size >1,000

**Databases:**
- PubMed/MEDLINE
- ClinicalTrials.gov
- Cochrane Library
- Web of Science
- Google Scholar (for grey literature)
