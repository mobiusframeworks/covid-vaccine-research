## Statistical Conclusions

1. **Efficacy:** Both mRNA vaccines demonstrate >94% efficacy against symptomatic COVID-19 with very narrow confidence intervals, indicating robust and consistent protection.

2. **Safety:** Serious adverse events are rare. The most significant identified risk (myocarditis) occurs at rates of 3-6 per 100,000 doses, primarily in young males, with excellent recovery outcomes.

3. **Population Benefit:** Large population studies (up to 46 million participants) demonstrate either neutral or protective effects on all-cause mortality and cardiovascular outcomes.

4. **Risk-Benefit:** Across all age groups, benefits substantially outweigh risks, with benefit-risk ratios ranging from 250:1 to >1000:1 depending on age and transmission levels.

5. **Long-Term Safety:** Four-year follow-up data from 28 million individuals shows no excess mortality, providing strong evidence against long-term harms.

6. **Comparative Risk:** COVID-19 infection poses significantly higher risk for myocarditis (5.6×), cardiovascular events, and death compared to vaccination across all studied populations.
